VIT Bhopal- Taxi Booking System
(A mini Python Project)


Introduction:
The Taxi Booking System is a simple Python project developed for VIT Bhopal students as part of the VITYARTHI “Build Your Own Project” initiative.
The project uses basic Python concepts only—lists, loops, conditionals, and functions—no advanced topics, no file handling, no OOP, and no external libraries.

It simulates taxi booking from VIT Bhopal to nearby locations:  Bhopal Junction
